- Second round of assignment: 185, 187, 189, 263, 268, 302 are extraneous second assignments that do not match Debbie's packet.
*How does Debbie decide who gets a second assignment or not?Â What location in rotation does she begin the second iteration? Does it begin  arbitrarily or at the start?*
- 78, 112, 116, 119 are assigned by Debbie but not in the bidding script. *Job positions are filled, but why are extra positions given out? Should we constrain this?*
- 299, 301, 307, 310, 311, 317, 318 are assigned by Debbie but not in the bidding script. *Manually input INV assignments?*
