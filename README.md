# BUGS
Second round of assignment: 185, 187, 189, 263, 268, 302 are extraneous second assignments that do not match Debbie's packet
How does Debbie decide who gets a second assignment or not?Â What location in rotation does she begin the second iteration? Arbitrary or at the start

Job positions are filled, but why are extra positions given out? How to constrain this? 78, 112, 116, 119 are assigned by Debbie but not Python code

Manually input INV assignments? 299, 301, 307, 310, 311, 317, 318
